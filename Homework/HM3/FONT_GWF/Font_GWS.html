Dantes stood up and looked in front of the boat. A hundred metres away, he saw the black and 
frightening shape of the rock where the Chateau d'If stands. The prison was about 300 years old. 
'People tell many strange stories about this place, 'Dantes thought. 'Prisoners go there and never 
return. Is this the end of all hope?'
Edmond Dantes is a successful young seaman. He has a loving
father and a beautiful lover, Mercedes, who is going to marry him. Soon he is going to be the 
captain of his own ship. What can go wrong in his life?
Edmond has enemies who hate his success. They tell the government that he is helping Napoleon. 
Napoleon wants to return to France as its ruler. On the day of Edmond's wedding to Mercedes, he is 
taken to the prison at the Chateau d'If and thrown into a dark, frightening underground room. Is 
this the end of his life as a free man?
Another prisoner, Faria, tells Edmond about some treasure on the island of Monte Cristo. The two 
men try to escape from the prison, but Faria dies from a serious illness. Will Edmond escape? Will 
he reach the island of Monte Cristo and find the treasure? And will he ever return to his father 
and Mercedes in the city of Marseilles?
This exciting adventure story takes place in France in the 1800s. Some of the people and places in 
it are real.
When the writer Alexandre Dumas was born in  1802, Napoleon became ruler of France. For many years 
he fought wars across Europe, and France became a very strong country. But in 1814, Napoleon's 
enemies sent him away from France to the island of Elba. These enemies — Prussia, Russia, Britain, 
Austria, Sweden and other countries — brought the Bourbon
kings back to rule France. Many French people did not like these new rulers, and Napoleon knew 
this. In 1815, the year when The Count of Monte Cristo begins, he returned to his home country.
Napoleon escaped from Elba and sailed to Cannes, in the south of France. His friends joined him 
there and he went to Paris. The king, Louis XVIII, left the country. Napoleon reached Paris on 20th 
March and became the ruler of France for one hundred days. Then he lost a great fight at Waterloo 
and he was sent to the island of St Helena. He died there in 1821.
We read about another real person in this book - Cesare Borgia. The Borgia family played an 
important part in Italian history. Cesare Borgia was born in 1475. His father, Roderigo Borgia, 
became Pope* Alexander VI in 1492. Cesare was a politician and a soldier. He fought for, and won, 
many Italian cities, but he was a hard and unkind ruler. After his father died, Cesare went to 
prison.
Later, he escaped to Spain and fought for the King of Navarre.
The prison of the Chateau d'If stands at the entrance to the old French port of Marseilles. As 
Edmond Dantes says, in the past this was a prison for 'important people, enemies of the king'. 
Today it holds no prisoners, but visitors can go there. Many of these visitors have read The Count 
of Monte Cristo.
The writer of this book was one of two famous French writers called Alexandre Dumas. They were 
father and son. Dumas p re (father) wrote The Count of Monte Cristo and many other stories. He is 
still the most widely read of all French writers.
He was born in 1802. His father was a soldier with Napoleon, but died in 1806 and left very little 
money for his family. Alexandre went to school for a short time, but at the age of sixteen he 
started work. He read a lot of books and liked the
plays of William Shakespeare and the stories of Sir Walter Scott. Dumas also started to write for 
magazines and the theatre.
Dumas enjoyed travel and adventure. He joined Garibaldi in Sicily in 1860. He was part of 
Garibaldi's fight to make Italy into 'one great country'. This is the same 'great country' that 
Faria dreams of in The Count of Monte Cristo.
Dumas wrote this book in 1844. He got the idea from a true story about a French shoemaker who was 
going to marry a rich woman. His enemies lied about him and he went to prison. There, a man told 
him about some treasure hidden in Italy. When the shoemaker left prison, he found the treasure. He 
became a rich man.
In  1844  Dumas  wrote  another  famous  story,  The  Th Musketeers, about France in the 1600s. His 
stories were very popular because they were full of brave men, beautiful women, dangerous 
adventures and excitement. Dumas wrote more than 1,200 books before he died in France in 1870. He 
turned his writing into a business. Young people helped him with his books
and at the same time learned to write well.
Dumas was very successful in France and other countries.
Many of his books were read in English. He made a lot of money
- but he spent most of it on the Chateau de Monte Cristo (his
house in the country), women and unsuccessful business plans.

It is two hundred years since Dumas wrote The Count of Monte
Cristo, but the book is still very popular. Readers love the story of
the honest and kind young man who is sent to prison. Edmond Dantes' life is destroyed by his 
enemies, but in Dumas' book good is stronger than bad. We know that Dantes will find a way to 
escape from the Chateau d'If and his enemies. One day he will be a successful man again.
The Count of Monte Cristo was first filmed in 1908. The pictures in this book are taken from a film 
for television. Richard Chamberlain played Edmond Dantes and Kate Nelligan was Mercedes.
